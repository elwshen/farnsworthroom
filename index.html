articles = {"milner-era":"<b>Florence Milner's Era (1916-1937)</b><br>The Farnsworth Room under Florence Milner’s supervision held special significance for many undergraduates.  It was a beautiful, expansive room in Widener Library, decorated with candelabras, crimson hangings, and, on the mantel, a panel commemorating sacrifice in war. And In Mrs. Milner’s scrapbooks, which she kept throughout her tenure as curator of the Farnsworth Room, are letters and quotes from alumni and former room attendants detailing how much the Room means to them.  As one freshman in 1919 said, “It’s different from any other place in college for there’s a personal touch.  It’s something to write home about.”  A former assistant of the room, writing to Mrs. Milner in 1920, said, “Of all the friends I made outside of my college-fellows, you were the best and dearest of all.”<br>A retired English teacher and principal from a boy’s school in Michigan, Mrs. Milner understood and was beloved by the young men who frequented the Farnsworth Room. A 1929 profile on Mrs. Milner in National Magazine explores her special charm:<blockquote>“In this room it is Mrs. Milner’s ‘something’ indefinable that has made supervision a grateful, tactful method when rebuke is necessary which it seldom is…The very absence of rules is one of the interesting phases of Mrs. Milner’s conduct of the room….Another element in her manner of administration is that of letting her readers alone.”</blockquote>At a point when Widener was not particularly hospitable to undergraduates, many found it liberating to freely explore new books.  Even so, a set of rules was strictly enforced, including no smoking, sprawling on chairs, note-taking, or studying of any kind.  In her scrapbooks, Mrs. Milner loved to record stories about disciplining unruly undergraduates.  In one such instance, a student came into the room and was choosing between reading “The Broad Highway” and “The Amateur Gentleman,” and finally settled on “The Broad Highway.”  A few minutes later, she found him “lolling lazily” with his feet on a chair, and, much to his chagrin, remarked that he should have picked “The Amateur Gentleman” instead.<br>But more than embarrassing young men, Mrs. Milner aimed to shape their minds and reading habits by curating a collection of “Standard Literature.” Half the room’s collection was English literature from Beowulf to Edith Wharton, with an emphasis on older classics, including novels, essays, poetry, criticism, and biographies, and by introducing students to good books Mrs. Milner hoped to be a positive cultural influence.  Under Mrs. Milner, the Farnsworth Room was truly a “gentleman’s library”: a luxurious room where young men learned proper conduct and proper literary taste.  David McCord, an alumnus reflecting on the room in 1947, described the Farnsworth Room as “the library of a cultivated person,” and stated that “a time for any man to lay the foundations of his life’s reading is in his later school days, his college or university years.  If he has not acquired, by the time he is thirty, a few shelves of good and lasting books which for him are always ‘home to the instant need of things,’ he has neglected or lost not the least valuable part of his education.”",
  "establishment":"<b>Establishment of the Farnsworth Room</b><br>Henry Weston Farnsworth attended Harvard College as an undergraduate at the start of the 20th Century. As well as being a noted adventure-seeker he was also an avid reader during and after his time at the University. Upon completion of his undergraduate degree in 1912, Henry became a newspaper correspondent in Mexico where he could fulfill his love for adventure; traveling the world and chasing stories.<br>While abroad, Henry decided to join the French Foreign Legion in January of 1915. Later that year, in September 1915, he was killed in action at Bois Sabot, just outside Navarin Farm, in France. On December 5, 1916, Henry’s parents, Mr and Mrs Farnsworth, established a room at Harvard University dedicated to the encouragement of extracurricular reading among undergraduate students in loving memory of their son, known simply as “The Farnsworth Room”. This is arguably the nation’s first memorial to an American soldier who lost his life in World War I as the room was dedicated four months before the United states officially entered the war.<br>This room is special, however, for more than one reason. As well as being the first memorial to a fallen American during the Great War, it is also the first established collegiate extracurricular reading room; created to encourage students’ love of reading and to provide a relaxing place in which they could pursue this love. The room was donated and funded by the parents of Henry Farnsworth under some conditions, including that the books kept within the room must be solely for the purpose of enjoyment and not for study, it must be kept neat, and it must provide a comfortable and relaxing space for students to enjoy reading extracurricular books such as Henry had done.<br>Although the room has changed location from its original place in the Widener library to its new home on the third floor of Lamont library, the nature of the room and its rich history is still prevalent. With the help of a memorial cabinet dedicated to Henry’s life and the room’s original purpose located to your left upon entrance, students today can still find as rich a connection to Henry and the purpose of the room as the first students to use the space did almost a century ago.","post":"<b>Post-Mrs. Milner (1950-1990)</b><br>In January 1949, Lamont Library opened as Harvard’s first library designed specifically for undergraduates.  The Farnsworth Room was moved to the fifth floor of Lamont, and, according to a Library Bulletin article written in Spring of 1950, was “more popular than ever.”  Lamont Librarian Henry James took it upon himself to revive the Farnsworth Room in the early 1960s, focusing on catering to student taste as part of his effort to make Lamont an important part of the “student’s total educational experience.”  He administered a questionnaire on the Farnsworth Room in April 1962, and out of 500 respondents, 37% used the room regularly, only a dozen had never heard of it, 44% liked to study there, and 32% read the books there.  Students claimed they didn’t read there for lack of time or because the collection wasn’t interesting or modern; they liked the cartoon books, humor anthologies, and picture and art books the best, and 26% requested more magazines.<br>The student committee in charge of reporting the survey results asserted that “the concept of recreational reading today is quite different from the ‘gentleman’s library of 1916 which still clutters the shelves”: they recommended that the collection include more avant-garde, experimental fiction, popular magazines, sports and outdoor books, and commentaries on arts, films, theater, music, and literature.  James weeded some of the older sets and classics and replaced them with modern, light reading but, according to a Crimson article, reminded students that “this is a college, not a public library room,” and would not include content as light as “Peanuts” or “Captain Billy’s Whizband.”  His efforts were well-received nonetheless, since in 1963 students from the Harvard Council for Undergraduate Affairs noted that “the Farnsworth Room, largely the creation of Mr. James himself, is well-liked.”<br>In 1974, Stratis Haviaras became curator of the Farnsworth Room after the Librarian of Harvard College, Louis Martin, decided that the Farnsworth and Poetry Rooms should be curated primarily by a single person.  Looking back on the Room’s management in the past decade, Haviaras criticized that book selection was done by Lamont staff and argued that the room essentially became an extension of the library collection.  In his words, “Inevitably, the Farnsworth collection began to lose its ‘unusual’ character.  Hobbies, sports, ‘how-to’ books and other works of ephemeral value overwhelmed the collection, and further weeding was neglected.”  Under his guidance, the collection was weeded more regularly, books of “ephemeral” value were cut down, and the room emphasized prose by contemporary poets, avant-garde fiction not purchased by any other Harvard library, biographies, science fiction and mystery paperbacks replaced every two years, and books on the visual, plastic, and performing arts.  Haviaras especially focused on stocking the room with translated works and works on the cultures of ethnic minorities.  He even hoped to incorporate audio visual equipment, including a video camera, recording deck, and monitors, and supply video tapes on the cultures of ethnic minorities.<br>By the 80’s, the room’s emphasis on ethnic minorities, prose works of poets, and experimental fiction had persisted.  With House libraries and common spaces, students had greater access to books and informal reading spaces, and had less need for a place like the Farnsworth Room—as a 1986 article in the Library Bulletin put it, the Farnsworth Room had been adapted to “fill a particular niche in the Harvard Library system.”",
  "present":"<b>Present Day Use</b><br>As we know, the original purpose of the Farnsworth Room was a space dedicated to relaxation and the enjoyment of extracurricular reading; it was a room designed to be a ‘getaway’ from the busy campus life where deadlines and finals drive students to new heights of stress; it was created by book lovers, for book lovers, and was seen as a sanctuary where one could get lost for a few hours in a world of their choosing.<br>This was the intended purpose for the room when it was created at the start of the 20th century. Now that it is 2015 we wanted to find out how present day undergraduates use this sanctuary; of course times have changed dramatically since its opening, yet we were curious to see whether the foundations and ideals from which the room was created were firmly held over the decades or whether the recent shift in focus of an undergraduate education, from learning to think to acquiring a degree, has changed the mindset of today’s youth in regards to the importance of extracurricular reading.<br>To do this we did three things; First, we visited the Farnsworth room and took note of the layout, the feel, the people using the room, and what they where using it for. Next, we interviewed several of the people in the room, asking them how often they used the room, what they used it for, whether an extracurricular reading room was still necessary at todays college, etc. Finally, we took this survey to the wider undergraduate community and acquired their answers to the same questions about the room to get a better general consensus.<br>Upon visiting the room, we all noticed the staggering amount of people NOT using the room for its originally intended purpose; extracurricular reading. Instead what we found were undergraduates, grad students and staff members alike, sitting at the various desks either using laptops, eating/drinking or studying for class; all of which were originally banned practices when the room was founded (including use of the room from graduate students and staff members).<br>From the interviews with students in the room we found that the most common use of the space was for homework, and that the majority had never read anything from the shelves; from those who had the most popular choice was a novel. Although most believed in the need for an extracurricular reading room in the library, few realized the intended purpose of the Farnsworth room, in which they were currently sitting.<br><img src='images/graph1.png' style='width:350px;padding-right:20px'><img src='images/graph2.png' style='width:350px;padding-right:20px'><img src='images/graph3.png' style='width:350px;padding-right:20px'><br><b>The Future of the Room</b><br>Students presently attending Harvard College were asked in a survey about the Farnsworth room what changes they would make to the room if they had the opportunity to do so. A common response was to lower the level of Air Conditioning to provide a warmer, possibly more comfortable, space to read and relax. The need for more comfortable chairs and less tables was also often noted; students seem to like the large leather chairs in the wellness area. Some students go further to suggest “comfy couches”, “cool beanbags” and “tons of snacks” as possible improvements to the room.<br>It seems as though the general consensus among students about the types of books they would like available in the room is shifting more and more from classic novels and renowned literature to comic books, travel guides, graphic novels and the latest best selling novels from pop culture. At the present time the room hosts a great range of books from the “classics” to comic book series and most genres in between. This aspect of the room seems to be well under control as the hard working staff in charge of the room are always on the lookout for certain books that have not circulated for some time. These books will be removed from the room and placed in a different section of the library to make room for new books and series that are popular among students of today; complimenting the room’s original purpose to serve the curious minds of avid readers in the undergraduate community. With the ever changing interests of each generation of students it is easy to imagine the titles lining the walls of the room to be unrecognizable in another hundred years, just as the books today are vastly different to those originally donated in 1916.<br>The future of the Farnsworth room, in the most basic terms, will be the same as it was first intended to be and how it is today; a space for students to read and relax. What they read and on what furniture they relax has changed and may possibly change in the future, and the location of the room may also change as it did mid 20th century, but the purpose of the room is and always will be to provide an environment for undergraduates to relax, read or work in a quiet and comfortable space. The room will most likely continue to be used primarily as a noise-free study space by students, whether undergraduate or not, and although this was not its intended purpose the Farnsworth room will forever be filled with a rich history and provide a sense of welcomeness to set it apart from just another study space in the Harvard library.",
  "book-collecting":"<b>Past Book-collecting Policy</b><br>Even though there was no one set policy that guides book collecting of the Farnsworth Room, delving into the scrapbooks of Mrs. Milner, the first librarian of the Farnsworth Room and the records of a librarian Keyes D. Metcalf reveal some aspects about the book collection of the Farnsworth Room particularly. Huge portion of its book collection was comprised of English literature, as K.D. Metcalf emphasizes English Literature as a “very strong field” of the Farnsworth Room. Farnsworth Room tried to encompass as various authors as they can rather than including a huge volume of a single author that “will give an undergraduate the chance to choose the worst of the lot and so conceive a distaste for the man and his works” (Metcalf 1947). Librarians hoped that Farnsworth Room would be “a basis” that will lead the students into the larger collection in the stack of the whole library. On the other hand, due to its weakness in science book collection, from 1937, librarians’ effort of including more science related books into the Farnsworth Room can be witnessed. Books in the Farnsworth Room were replaced often and the ones that were replaced were not discarded but moved into the undergraduate library so that students can still have access to those books.<br>This book collection of the Farnsworth Room was mainly organized and managed by the librarian in charge, such as Mrs. Milner, but many recommendations from the faculty members were highly appreciated and even requested so that they can garner information from the experts in each area. Its book collection also had much influence in the collection of other public libraries such as Detroit Public Library by establishing itself as a pioneer of a room for pleasure reading.<br>Lastly, it is interesting how Mrs. Milner, who was very much managing every part of the Farnsworth Room in its early days, regarded some books as low level and thought that the Farnsworth Room should educate the students to move from those low level books to high level books. For example, Mrs. Milner emphasizes the importance of cultural influence of the Farnsworth Room by narrating about one boy who asked for a story about a man who kills a woman and boils up her body.<br>There was no written rule about what kind of books should be in the Farnsworth Room. However, one rule that was agreed by all librarians and Henry Farnsworth himself was that books in the Farnsworth Room should be interesting enough so that students can feel the pleasure of reading and maybe move on to another book of that author.<br><b>Present Book-collecting Policy</b><br>An interview with Katherine Leach, a librarian who is in charge of book collecting for the Farnsworth Room, has revealed many aspects of current book collecting process of the Farnsworth Room. It is similar with the policy of the past in that there is no one set rule regarding which books should be on the shelves of the Farnsworth Room. Rather it is decided by a group of librarians who are interested in the Farnsworth Room during the once-a-month meeting on Friday. While the books for all the other libraries have to pass approval plans, no such thing exists for the Farnsworth Room. All the books are handpicked by the librarians. Katie mentioned that librarians refer to many book review online sites, but not prestigious ones like New York Times for the books of the Farnsworth Room. Katie explained that since many prestigious book review sites have their own standard of what can be considered as literature, but the Farnsworth Room needs something outside of that boundary, everything that is entertaining for the students. Librarians for the Farnsworth also accept suggestions from students, faculty members, and other librarians as well. Books for the Farnsworth Room tend to reflect the popular trend of the time, such as detective novels and supernatural fiction. Katie indicates how she doesn’t want to fill the shelves of the Farnsworth Room with “dark and depressing” books but with more entertaining books. Due to the space limit, book collection for the room should be very strategic. For example, they won’t buy the whole series of an author if Widener Library will buy the series anyway. Even now, books of the Farnsworth Room are being circulated very often and the books that aren’t circulated for a long time will be replaced with other books. With the rise of technology and its convenience, Farnsworth Room is also looking forward to the implementation of a system that will make it available for the students to access books of the Farnsworth Room through internet with a form of e-books."};
